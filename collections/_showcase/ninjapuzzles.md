Ninja Puzzles is a website for puzzle lovers. It has a collection of free downloadable puzzles including Sudoku, Word Search, Kriss Kross, Mazes and more. It uses ElementalCSS for the layout and styling of the website. The website is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Dark mode is disabled on Ninja Puzzles, but everything else uses the default colours. There are a handful of custom CSS styles added to the website - such as the prominent drop shadow on headings, to make the design more unique.
