Brush Ninja is an edTech website. The primary app being an Animated Gif Maker. The website started off with custom css, and added ElementalCSS later. Adding ElementalCSS sped up development and helped to make the design more consistent. Brush Ninja uses a custom ElementalCSS build with additional colours. It does this by including ElementalCSS in the SASS build process and overriding the default colour properties.
