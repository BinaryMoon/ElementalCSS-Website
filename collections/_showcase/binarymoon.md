Binary Moon is the personal blog and portfolio website for Ben Gillbanks. He also made ElementalCSS and wrote this text. It uses ElementalCSS for the layout and styling of the website. The website is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

For Binary Moon Ben disabled dark mode, and used some custom colours to make the design more unique.
