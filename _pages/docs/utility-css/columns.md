Columns use CSS columns to automatically create responsive columns of content. Columns are responsive by default and the number of columns used will vary based upon the screen width.

These are separate to flexbox and grid.

They are ideal for multi column designs like newspapers. I like to use them for creating large lists of links such as dictionaries or glossaries.
