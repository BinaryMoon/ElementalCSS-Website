Using ElementalCSS is easy. You can use the CSS directly from the CDN, or you can download the files and use them locally.

## CDN

The easiest way to use ElementalCSS is to link to the CDN. This will give you the latest version of the CSS.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/elementalcss/dist/elementalcss.min.css">
```

## Download

You can download the latest version of ElementalCSS from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BinaryMoon/ElementalCSS/tree/main/dist).

## HTML

Once you have the CSS included in your page I recommend adding the following meta tag to your page. This will ensure that the browser knows that you are using a dark mode compatible theme.

```html
<meta name="color-scheme" content="dark light">
```
