ElementalCSS uses Gulp to build the CSS styles from the SCSS source files.

## Installation

You can install Gulp and the required packages with npm. Pull the Git repository content into your local environment and then run npm install.

## Building the CSS

Everything happens in a single Gulp task.

	gulp build

This task will generate the CSS, and minified CSS for all of the different files.
